Starts with B. 

In this case, only if the second part has only As 
will it be true that all letters of the first part 
will be after all the letters of the second part.

Since this is a permutation of the alphabet, the last letter must be A. 
Now it must be arranged so that a 25 letter arrangement ending with B
is a pat. For this to be true a 24 letter arrangement ending in " " must
be a pat. This must be C, otherwise the letter arrangement would have C
in the first half, and a letter after it in the second. Continuing the pattern:

B...A
B...C A
B D...C A 
Then it would go
BDFHJLNPRTVXZYWUSQOMKIGECA
and if I swap the middle two (ZY) for example, then it wouldn't work because the last
arrangement would be YZ - which is not a pat. 

Therefore there is only one possible arrangement.

This has now been tested in the main.py program. True. Therefore there is 
exactly 1 permutation of the alphabet beginning with B which is a pat.
