There will be up to 5000 moves. In this case - make a 5000 by 5000 grid.
Since these are triangles, here are the options: 
1. Move left or right on your row
2. If the sum of your row and column is even(so every other square)
move down
3. If the sum of your row and column is odd
move up. 
Players move clockwise so to move "around" a filled triangle:

If said triangle is an "even" one it points upwards. so if a player is on the left of it,
they move first 2 spots to the right in the grid, then below the triangle in the grid,
the go back to the spot on the left. 

If it is an "odd" triangle they move firstly to the spot above it, then to the one 2 two the right of it,
then to the one to the left. 

If a triangle is already filled, then going around the edge is simply doing a second turn. Therefore each
player will have its positioned notated by an edge.
This will be a specific coordinate, and a number from 1 to 3, going clockwise around the triangle.
